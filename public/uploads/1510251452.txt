Dear Sir,


As per my appointment letter, my probation period was over 07/07/2017 (3 month ago). After that date, I did not find any notification from you about my job permanent related issues.

I have notified you about this by sending an email. The email was sent at 8/7/2017, day by day I am really confused about my job confirmation and salary increment. So that, it will hamper my work. 

Please take necessary action regarding this issue as soon as possible.

Best Regards,
Tarek Ahammed
Software Engineer
